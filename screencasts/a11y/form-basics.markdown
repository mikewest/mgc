Hi, I'm Mike West, and I'd like to give you a quick overview of the very basics
of creating accessible forms. In doing so, I'll also introduce you to Chrome's
very own screen-reader: ChromeVox.

There are many types of disability that can effect a user's ability to interact
with your web application: here, I'd like to concentrate on visual and motor
imparements that make it impossible to use a mouse to navigate around a web
page. Users with these sorts of impairments generally use some sort of
assistive technology to render a visually rich application as a stream of
audible speech. As you can imagine, these programs need every bit of semantic
information about your site that they can get their hands on, in order to give
users a reasonably usable representation of the site's state.
