Hello, Internet! I'm Mike West, and I'd like to give you a brief introduction to accessibility on the web by walking you through the very very basics of how a user might interact with your site via a screen reader. I'm not going to get into anything really meaty today, though: I just want to provide some context for developers who haven't had any experience with assistive technologies. If you _have_ used screen readers before, great! You are the 1%! Go do something exciting other than watching this screencast, which is really just going to lay a baseline for future discussion. 

The kinds of accessibility that we most often deal with when building websites and applications are visual in nature. We want to ensure that people who can't _see_ the results of our hard work can still _use_ them productively. To do so, visually impaired users often make use of software that converts a site into an interactive amalgam of synthesized speech or braile output. As you might imagine, that's a bit of a different experience from the majority of your users, and it's something you need to keep in mind when building that Next Big Thing you're working on.

There are a few screen readers out there on the market, WindowEyes, JAWS, NVDA, and so on. Here, I'll be demonstrating one that's pretty trivial to get up and running: ChromeVox.
