Hello, Internet! I'm Mike West, and I'd like to give you a brief introduction to accessibility on the web. Before we get into anything meaty, though, I think it's important to provide some context for those of you who haven't had any experience with assistive technologies. If you _have_ used screen readers before, great! You are the 1%! Go do something exciting! With this screencast, I really just want to lay a baseline for future discussion.

The kinds of accessibility we most often deal with when building websites and applications are visual in nature. We want to ensure that people who can't _see_ the results of our hard work can nevertheless _use_ them productively. To do so, visually impaired users often make use of software that converts a site into an interactive amalgam of synthesized speech or braile output. As you might imagine, that's a bit of a different experience from the majority of your users, and it's something you need to keep in mind when building that Next Big Thing you're working on.
