One of the things I really admire about [Rands][] is his ability to take a topic that would be utterly formulaic in anyone else's hands, and turn it into an opus.  Case in point is his transformation of the perennial "What's your setup?" post into [something a bit deeper][foamy].  In a few quick paragraphs, he outlines the qualities he looks for in the tools he uses on a day to day basis, and explains how they fit into his world view.  This is a man who _knows_ what he uses, knows _why_ he uses what he uses, and constantly scans the landscape for something that more closely fits the criterion he's laid out.

I mention it here because it's a great post and well worth reading, but also because he says a few things that resonate with me, and deserve whatever slight amplification I can offer.

Context Shapes Perspective
--------------------------

In an annoyingly offhand yet polished way that I sincerely hope took _hours_ of editing to achieve, Rands points out that your perception of a problem space defines the way you go about attacking and solving a problem:

>   Context shapes perspective, so thanks to the contents of his garage, he
>   knows of no universe where there are chainsaws. He's heard of them ...
>   but there's no chainsaw here, so he's semi-happily hacking away.  To me,
>   standing there with my arsenal of chainsaws, it's absurd.

I cannot count the number of times that I've wasted hours of my life forcing the tools I know to fit tasks I didn't understand.  In particular, I remember manually saving off bits of data in flat files and building reports through brute-force "joining" before I knew anything useful about databases, while fudging around with absurd parsing mechanisms because I was equally unfamiliar with regular expressions.  As soon as I was introduced to the "correct" mechanism for matching patterns, I threw out every bit of verbose and buggy parsing code I'd written, and rebuilt a week's worth of work in an afternoon.

Rands emphasizes the fact that the correct tool will completely change the way you look at a problem, saving your time and sanity.  I'd emphasize a corollary: it's _incredibly_ important for you to be _curious_ about your work and _flexible_ in your approach.  The more information you can absorb about the problem spaces in which you've chosen to work, the better able you'll be to discover efficient solutions that don't waste your time.  If you're not interested in finding new ways of approaching old problems, and if you're not reading as much as you possibly can about things that are even tangentially related to your core competencies, then you've quite simply given up any hope of being a contributing member of a functional team.

Universal Access
----------------

Vim is oarsome, and Rands skims over that while boasting about his, frankly, idiotic way of maintaining production environments via FTP.
