I'm a web developer.  I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that _delight_ and _inform_.  I do it well.

I'm curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction.  I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.  The [list of projects I follow][github_follow] on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I'd prefer to be using, and [my Instapaper "Starred" list][instapaper_starred] will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.

Professional Bio
----------------

Since January 2009, I've been part of the team responsible for the web presence of one of the largest daily newspapers in Germany.  [Sueddeutsche.de][sde] gets something on the order of 150 million (actual) page views a month, and serves over 22 million unique users.  It's a big site, running on a surprisingly antiquated backend; we work hard to keep things running smoothly, and to meet the high expectations of our users.  Generally, we do a pretty good job of it.

Before Sueddeutsche, I worked for Yahoo! on their equally massive European news sites.  My team and I took `news.yahoo.com`'s solid codebase, and made it localizable for distinct markets and languages: we were directly responsible for building and maintaining Yahoo!'s news sites in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, relaunching all five within a year.  We laid the foundation for further work that expanded the platform's scope to include Singapore and beyond.  We did _good_ work while understaffed and under pressure, and I'm proud of our accomplishments.

In addition to my in-house work, I've written a variety of articles on development for publications such as [DigitalWeb][dw], [A List Apart][ala], and Opera's [Web Standards Curriculum][owsc].  I enjoy what I do, and I enjoy sharing tidbits with others.

Personal Bio

A slight clarification of the above: I'm actually a philosophy student _cleverly disguised_ as a successful web developer.  Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living sitting under a tree while reading Kant, I've focused my energies on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.

I moved to Germany from Texas a few years back, learned the language, and have settled in Munich for the time being.  I think I'll stick around here for a while...
