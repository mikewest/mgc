I told myself this morning that I'd write 500 words today.  I didn't tell myself that I'd write those words about anything in particular, nor did I decide beforehand that the words I'd write would absolutely be published.  I think I just need to get into the habit of sitting here, with my fingers on the keyboard, making the klackity-klack sound that Merlin Mann so brilliantly described in his essay of more or less the same name.

It's a little more difficult with Elisabeth in the room, not because I don't like her (i do!) but because she sometimes makes noise.  That sounds mean, I'm sure, but it's true.  She does.  As do other things.  Things that distract me and destroy my "flow", which I saw referenced this morning on Hacker News.  I find it odd, actually that someone would submit "news" to Hacker News that isn't really news at all.  Or an article.  Wikipedia is more or less the antithesis of the sorts of links that I'd like to see up on Hacker News, and certainly not something that I'd expect to be voted anywhere other than down into oblivion.

That said, what's on my mind?  Excellent question.  At the moment, what's on my mind is simply that I'm a terrible typist.  I mean, just look at all these typos.  I suspect that a third or more of the keystrokes I end up typing aren't the keystrokes that I actually wanted to type, but something else entirely, something simply and utterly wrong, that I need to backtrack to and remove, replacing them with things that aren't wrong.  Things that are correct.  Those are nicer, but nicer still would be to simply type the right thing to begin with. 

And now I've learned something!  Control-W in insert mode deletes the word just before the cursor!  And I've mapped it to Control-Backspace as well!  This is amazing!  Just think about how much faster I could theoretically type if I could only hit those keys more quickly.  Maybe I'll think about speeding up backspace too.  Let's try that out.  So.  If this works correctly, three backspaces should do the work of Control-W.  It works!  But slowly.  I think I need to take another look at the mapping code to see if I can reduce the timeout time, because it's currently driving me nuts.  Maybe <leader-W>?  Works, but it's not terribly functional.  Hrm.  I'll think about what I could possibly type a little more simply than what I've currently got.

What is the role of a news organization?  Especially one with a large internet presence, available 24/7 to a global audience?

1.  To give people what they're looking for.  The organization ought have a voice with which its readers identify, and it should maintain that editorial direction throughout the pieces it produces.  I'm thinking here particularly about financial and political news, but giving an opinion, and defending it rationally should be a part of the way news is presented.

This is not to say that the facts ought be distorted or edited to fit an editorial preference.  You don't get to choose your facts, period.

2.  To challenge reader's preconceptions.  In opposition to #1, the editorial voice of the paper ought not be so strident that alternative viewpoints and interpretations of the same facts are excluded.  It's stunningly easy to find oneself in an echo chamber on the internet, and any sane news source should be proud to link off to alternative viewpoints in highly visible ways.  These alternative views and interpretations should be discussed rationally, but above all they should simply be available.

3.  To remove distractions.  If I want to browse through celebrity gossip, that should be the focus of the pages I visit.  Filling the page with "calls to action" linking off to alternative sources of clicks for the website encourages me to _stop_ reading, which is exactly the opposite of what I think an website should encourage [lookup reference at "a working library" @TODO]
