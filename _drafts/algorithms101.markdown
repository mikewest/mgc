I have a rocky relationship with computer science.  In high cchool and college, I paid attention only to the bits that I saw immediate use for; since I was focused on web stuff, that meant that I more or less avoided the classroom entirely.  Why would I need to understand anything at all about compilers or assembly or logic?  That stuff was _obviously_ unrelated to the exciting world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

Much of the material I ignored in college was indeed unrelated to the work that I've done over the last seven years since graduation.  My time probably _was_ better spent fiddling about with CSS, and googling my way through quick and dirty solutions to problems, filling the gaps in my knowledge on a just-in-time basis.  That's served me astoundingly well, but the more I learn, the more I notice that I'm an idiot when it comes to a wide variety of interesting programming questions.

I don't like being an idiot.
