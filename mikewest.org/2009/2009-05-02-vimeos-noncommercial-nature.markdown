Vimeo's asked [Marco Armet][marco] to take down his Instapaper Pro demo video.  [His response][response]:

<blockquote><p>Vimeo usually makes good policy decisions. But their complete prohibition of anything that can remotely be considered for commercial purposes, even with a paid Plus account, doesn&#8217;t strike me as particularly necessary. I really don&#8217;t see why this is the right move.</p></blockquote>

I can sympathize with Marco's frustration.  Vimeo is probably the highest-quality video site on the net.  The player is minimal, and better thought-out than most that I've seen elsewhere.  The community is engaged and excellent in a way that YouTubers never will be, and the discovery tools are as good as Flickr's (which is high praise indeed).  From that perspective, it's exactly the right place to post a commercial video that you want people to watch, and get excited about.

However, I believe that Vimeo is a great place to get the right kind of attention for your product _precisely because_ they've had an explicitly "personal" ethos from the start.  They've built up a community of creative _people_ who want to share their creations and _life_ with the world, and the policy decisions they've settled upon are focused on maintaining that community experience.  Opening that up to commercial exploitation would be intensely counter-productive; YouTube is evidence of that.  It's clear to me that Vimeo would be a worse place were it to allow itself to be overrun with moneymaking ventures...

In some ways, this is a shame, as projects like [Instapaper][] and [Birdhouse][] are definitely best of breed in terms of supportable business opportunities.  And, honestly, they're examples of _personal_ products in a way that Vimeo probably wasn't thinking about when they codified their standards.  But I can sympathize with their position: Vimeo has taken a hard line against commercial activity (as well as other sorts of activity that don't fit their model: [video game captures][video] for instance), and making exceptions for cool products from cool business ventures simply isn't sustainable.

As much as I love Instapaper (and [I love Instapaper][love]), Vimeo isn't the right place for it to be advertised.
