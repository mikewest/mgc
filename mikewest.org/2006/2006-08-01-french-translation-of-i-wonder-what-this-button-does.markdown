Parlez-vous français?  If so, you'll be interested in [John Garner's][john] [translation into French][translation] of last week's [introduction to revision control systems][article].

«[Je me demande à quoi sert ce bouton?][translation]» is available on John's website.  He's done a great job with this translation (or so I'm told :) ), and it was fascinating to work with him to make sure that the various important bits of the article made their way into French.

As an aside, if translation is at all interesting to you, I highly recommend [Douglas Hofstadter's][hofstadter] book "[Le Ton beau de Marot][book]."  It changed the way I think about language...  Probably the best book I've ever read.  :)
