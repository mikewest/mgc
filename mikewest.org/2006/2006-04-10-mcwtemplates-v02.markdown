`mcw_templates` is a TextPattern admin plugin, enabling the trivial export of pages, forms, and CSS rules to a specified folder for convenient editing, and the subsequent import of new and updated files.

The new version adds the ability to hold multiple exports and imports, instead of being limited to a single template set.
