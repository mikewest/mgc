I've barely touched my computer since Sunday night.  I have about 50 actual e-mails piled up that I need to take a look at, several thousand unread items in NetNewsWire (apparently I need to trim down my feeds a bit), and real, live work that's not getting done.

I have the impression that the frolicing birds just outside my window are singing extra loudly in the morning, flitting through the air extra happily, basking in the sun extra warmly.  Mocking me.  Stupid birds.

I _hate_ being sick.

My regularly scheduled life will resume as soon as the tiny men in my head stop jumping around in my sinuses.
