Teaser:
  I had the opportunity to present a few demos during the Chrome section of 
  Saturday's Google Developer Day in Berlin (which, incidentally, was a blast).
  I expect a video to go up at some point in the vaguely near future, but, since
  I got more than a few questions about it, I'm throwing the links up here as a
  stopgap before the video's released.

I expect a video to go up at some point in the vaguely near future, but, since
I got more than a few questions about it, I'll throw the links up here with a
bit of background and credit for each. Incidentally, thanks to [Paul
Kinlan][paul] for taking [some pictures][pics] during the demos. I'm glad I have
something to show here as a stopgap before the video's ready!

* The [first demo][demo1] was pulled from a talk [Mike Bostock][bostock] gave
  just last week, highlighting the power of the impressive [D3.js][d3]. D3 is a
  free JavaScript library that makes it easy to bind data to a DOM, and then
  generate stunning visualizations based on those bindings. His [entire
  presentation][pres1] is well worth checking out, and really highlight what an
  often overlooked technology like SVG is capable of.

  [![Check out D3, it's quite nice.][demo1img]][d3]

* Next, I pulled out an oldie-but-goodie: [Joe Lambert's][joe] [Flux
  Slider][flux]. It's a quick demonstration of the power of CSS-based
  transitions, and really well suited to venues like GDD, as it makes the
  capabilities of modern browsers immediately visually apparent. If you haven't
  seen it yet, take a look. It's another open-source library, so fiddle with
  [the code][code] as well.

  [![Flux Slider is pretty, play with it!][demo3img]][flux]

* Obviously, no HTML5 demo is complete without WebGL, and no WebGL demo is
  complete without [Mr.doob][mr] and [three.js][three]. I introduced the topic
  by throwing a [huge, Kinect-driven Mr.doob][kinect] onto the wall behind me.

* I followed up the introduction with a [beautiful terrain rendering][terrain]
  from [AlteredQualia][altered]. What I liked most about that demo is the fact
  they they've pulled pieces from the [ro.me][rome] project to save time and
  effort. Open source is brilliant.

* Finally, I pulled the [HTML5 Wow Visualizer][viz] from [Eric][e] and
  [Arne][a]'s excellent [I/O 2011 presentation][wow]. It's still the best
  WebAudio API demo out there, clearly demonstrating the power of the analyzer
  and showing off things that simply aren't possible with the `audio` tag.

And that's it. Fiveish quick demos in about five minutes. I enjoyed it! What did
you think?
