  "I had the distinct pleasure of talking with folks at this year's CSSConf EU
   about the dangers of content-injection attacks. They're not just for
   JavaScripters, you see: CSS is dangerous too! They've just posted the video,
   and I think it's worth a little under a half-hour of your time to skim
   through."

I had the distinct pleasure of talking with folks at this year's
[CSSConf EU][cssconf] about the dangers of content-injection attacks. They're
not just for JavaScripters, you see: CSS is dangerous too! They've just posted
the video, and I think it's worth a little under a half-hour of your time to
skim through. You'll be shocked to learn that [Content Security Policy][csp]
makes an appearance.

Credit is due to [Mario Heiderich][mario], et al. for their excellent paper
["Scriptless Attacks - Stealing the Pie Without Touching the Sill"][pie],
from which I stole much of the attack-based content. Awesome stuff.

Transcript is coming, but for now, please do enjoy the embedded video and
slides below:

The [slides are up on Speaker Deck][slides] (which is awesome), and I actually
used Speaker Deck to _present_ the slides from someone else's laptop since my
computer decided not to connect to the conference's projector. I love you,
Speaker Deck!
